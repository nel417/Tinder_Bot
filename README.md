Python bot to automate login and auto swipe/auto dislike. This is experimental code, there is a hiccup after phone login, it requests SMS verification. Looking into that, Auto dislike and Auto like features work well once logged in.

```bash
python3 index.py
```

## Usage

```python
phone_in.send_keys('Your Number Here')
```
